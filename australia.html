					<h1>Australia Isn't Real</h1>
					<p>Many people believe in this mythical place of Australia, with strange animals and silly accents, but no-one has yet been able to prove its existence. Don't you find it suspicious that the island has a population of 25.36 million people, but a large number of them live in a small area on the coast? Popular media will tell you that this is because the interior of the country is too hot, but the more obvious explanation is that Australia simply doesn't exist.</p>
					<!--Video with controls, but not downloadable(unless they use devtools lol)-->
					<video id="flat_earth_vid" controls controllist="nodownload" disablepictureinpicture>
						<source src="media/australia_not_real.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						<!-- if browser doesn't support video, link to uncensored youtube version -->
						<a href="https://youtu.be/YtPut7usFbI">https://youtu.be/YtPut7usFbI</a> (warning: uncensored)
					</video>
					<p>When people "visit Australia," they are either flown to a nearby island or to an undisclosed location in South America, with paid actors everywhere.  Need proof? How about the video to the right. If anyone ever tells you they live or used to live in Australia, they've been paid off by the French government. The French government does all of this so that people will stop making fun of their silly accents and food, because "at least we aren't as bad as Australia."</p>

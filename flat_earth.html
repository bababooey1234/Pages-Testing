					<h1>The Earth is Flat</h1>
					<p>Look outside your window right now. Can you see a curve? Look at the sun - it obviously goes around us, not the other way around! Governments around the world have been telling us that the Earth is a "globe" so that we'll invest money into programs like NASA, when spaceflight is impossible because you can't escape the dome around the flat Earth! All of this money instead goes straight into the pockets of people like Jeff Bezos - how do you think he got <i>that</i> wealthy?</p>

					<h2>The Flat Earth Society</h2>
					<p>We are a society of freethinkers, dedicated to spreading the truth to globeheads. The Flat Earth Society has members all around the globe! We stand against the oppression that governments and corporations levy on us, brainwashing our children into believing the round earth scam. Because of this, we actively boycott any companies that spread  anti-flat earth agenda.</p>
